To effectively enhance the readability and comprehensibility of your text, it's quintessentially imperative to adhere to a plethora of meticulously curated strategies, each woven into the fabric of linguistic presentation with the utmost care and attention to detail. Firstly, one must embark on the journey of utilizing clear and concise language, however, it's often beneficial to intersperse one's writing with a smattering of complex and grandiloquent terms, thereby adding a certain je ne sais quoi to the overall narrative, which, in turn, serves to not only elevate the prose but to imbue it with a certain verisimilitude that might otherwise be lacking in more straightforward, pedestrian writing. Furthermore, the structuring of sentences should be done in such a way as to maximize clarity, yet, paradoxically, employing convoluted sentence structures and a plethora of clauses can add a delightful complexity to the text, making it a veritable tapestry of linguistic prowess. Additionally, the paragraph should ideally be cohesive and maintain a focused theme, although, diverging into tangentially related subtopics and anecdotal meanderings can enrich the narrative, providing a kaleidoscopic array of perspectives and insights that, while potentially diverting from the main point, contribute to a richer, more layered understanding of the subject matter at hand.
```
```
**Approx.**: To enhance text readability and comprehension, employ clear and concise language while also using complex terms for flair. This approach elevates the prose, adding depth and authenticity. Sentence structure should be clear but can include complexity for richness. Paragraphs need a focused theme, yet exploring related subtopics and anecdotes can offer broader perspectives and insights, enriching the understanding of the topic.

**Accurate**: Improve text readability by using clear language with occasional complex terms for depth. Ensure sentences are understandable but can be intricate for interest. Maintain a coherent paragraph theme, but include related topics and anecdotes for a richer narrative.

**Loose**: Use clear language with some complex words for depth. Make sentences readable but interestingly complex. Keep paragraphs focused but explore related ideas for a richer narrative.

**Least**: Use clear, occasionally complex language. Write readable sentences with depth. Keep focused, but explore related ideas.

# Code Stylist
### It is recommended to use ChatGPT 4 or an **equivalent model** for handling complex programming languages.
> Formats code in three styles: simple, elegant, and clever, providing three code versions, no extra talk.
## E.g. CS1
**User:**
```py
def calculate_depth(if_positions, b_start, b_end):
	# Calculate depth based on the sizes of if statement blocks
	return sum(1 \
			for a_start, a_end, _ in if_positions \
			if a_start < b_start \
			and a_end > b_end \
			and a_end - a_start > b_end - b_start)
```

**Simple Style:**
```py
def calculate_depth(if_positions, b_start, b_end):
	depth = 0
	for a_start, a_end, _ in if_positions:
		if a_start < b_start and a_end > b_end:
			if a_end - a_start > b_end - b_start:
				depth += 1
	return depth
```

**Elegant Style:**
```py
def calculate_depth(if_positions, b_start, b_end):
	return sum(
		a_end - a_start > b_end - b_start
		for a_start, a_end, _ in if_positions
		if a_start < b_start and a_end > b_end
	)
```

**Clever Style:**
```py
def calculate_depth(if_positions, b_start, b_end):
	return sum(
		a_start < b_start < b_end < a_end and (a_end - a_start) > (b_end - b_start)
		for a_start, a_end, _ in if_positions
	)
```

# Ambiguity Detector
### Urged to regenerate 5+ to catch all ambiguities
> Enumerate any semantic, syntactic, lexical, and narrative types of ambiguities in any textual prompts. Don't guess overall meanings. Assume ambiguity and seek reasonable explanations. May ask for details.
## E.g. AD1
```
In order to, you know, get to the, like, really important stuff, I, uh, just wanted to, um, basically say that, well, I think, um, we should, like, definitely, you know, try to, uh, avoid using, you know, too many, like, filler words, because, you see, it, like, makes our, um, writing, well, kind of, you know, less clear and, um, more difficult to, you know, understand.
```
```
Your text contains several instances of ambiguity, primarily stemming from excessive use of filler words and vague expressions. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Semantic Ambiguity**: The overall message is obscured by the overuse of fillers like "you know," "like," "um," and "uh." These don't contribute to the meaning and make it unclear what the important elements of your statement are.

2. **Syntactic Ambiguity**: The sentence structure is disjointed and lacks clarity due to the insertion of these fillers. It's challenging to identify the main clauses and subordinate clauses, which affects the grammatical coherence of the sentence.

3. **Lexical Ambiguity**: Phrases like "really important stuff" and "our writing" are vague. It's unclear what specifically the "important stuff" refers to, and "our writing" could mean different things in different contexts (e.g., formal reports, casual conversations).

4. **Narrative Ambiguity**: The overarching point you're making is somewhat obscured. While it seems you're advocating for clearer writing by avoiding filler words, the message is delivered in a way that ironically exemplifies the issue you're highlighting.

To improve clarity, it would be helpful to rephrase your statement more concisely, directly addressing the main point without the use of filler words. Could you provide more specific details or restate your message with more clarity?

# Guidelines for programming best practices in Python syntax. These guidelines are allowed unless strictly stated.

preferred:
use dictionary mapping or match-case for 4 to 20 conditions to replace if-elif
look-up tables
nesting functions
continue keyword in all loops when needed
comment on illogical code lines
strictly use "tmp" (temp) and "ret" (return_) as abbreviations variable naming ('tmp' vars declaration disposed within 3 lines)
maximum of 3 indention levels at base level of the source file
type hints naming convention in variable names

avoid:
modifying global variables in any functions
negative wording variable names, e.g., "not" word in the name
double negation, e.g., a negative wording variable put in a negative condition
complex to read if statements, e.g., more than 2 conditions in a line
strictly no vary approach, e.g., writing the bound check in different ways
chaining methods

suggest:
strictly split high abstraction level functions over 30 lines
all functions do what their names said
strictly avoid more than 2 returns

simplify loops with these functions to improve readability if you can:
sum() # Totals iterable
filter() # Selects items
reduce() # Combines items
product() # Multiplies iterable
map() # Changes items
zip() # Pairs elements
enumerate() # Counts items
transpose() # Flips matrix
"""
```
```
The provided text contains guidelines for programming best practices in Python syntax. However, several ambiguities and unclear statements are present. I'll list them out and ask for clarifications where necessary:

1. **Ambiguity in "These guidelines are allowed unless strictly stated":** It's unclear what is meant by "allowed." Does this mean that these practices are recommended, or are they permissible but not necessarily recommended? Clarification on the intended meaning would be helpful.

2. **Ambiguity in "use dictionary mapping or match-case for 4 to 20 conditions to replace if-elif":** It's unclear whether this guideline suggests using dictionary mapping and match-case exclusively for situations where there are 4 to 20 conditions, or if it's a general recommendation with specific emphasis on this range.

3. **Ambiguity in "nesting functions":** Does this suggest that nesting functions is a preferred practice, or is it advising to look out for nested functions? The context is not clear.

4. **Unclear guideline on "continue keyword in all loops when needed":** The phrase "when needed" is vague. Could you provide criteria or examples to clarify when the use of the 'continue' keyword is considered necessary?

5. **Unclear instruction in "comment on illogical code lines":** It's ambiguous what constitutes an "illogical" code line. Are there specific criteria or examples that define illogical code lines?

6. **Ambiguity in variable naming conventions:** The guideline strictly advises using "tmp" and "ret" for abbreviations in variable naming, but it's not clear if these are the only abbreviations allowed, or if they're just examples of acceptable abbreviations.

7. **Ambiguity in "maximum of 3 indention levels at base level of the source file":** It's unclear what is meant by "base level of the source file." Does this refer to the top-most level of code outside of any class or function definitions, or does it apply to each function or class individually?

8. **Ambiguity in "type hints naming convention in variable names":** This guideline lacks specificity. What exactly is the naming convention for type hints in variable names? 

9. **Unclear guideline on "strictly no vary approach":** The term "vary approach" is not a standard term and is ambiguous. Could you explain what is meant by this?

10. **Ambiguity in "chaining methods":** It's unclear whether this guideline advises against the practice of chaining methods altogether or if it suggests avoiding excessive or certain types of method chaining.

11. **Vagueness in "all functions do what their names said":** While this seems straightforward, it might be helpful to define what constitutes a clear and descriptive function name.

12. **Ambiguity in simplifying loops with listed functions:** It's unclear whether these functions are simply suggested as useful tools, or if there's a specific guideline on how to use them to simplify loops.

Could you provide clarifications or additional context for these points to ensure a clear understanding of the guidelines?
