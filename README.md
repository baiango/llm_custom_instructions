# Tricks for ChatGPT
<details><summary>Tricks</summary>

- ✔️ Prompts are biased by past inputs. Be vague for broader recommendations (Remember, the perception of bias is shaped by your values. When you're asking someone, you're asking someone to say what you wanted to hear.)
- ✔️ Force it to be brief by asking it to make 20+ or large list
- ✔️ Reduce jargon and explain in the custom instructions to maintain compatibility between models
- ✔️ Use [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) correct prompts and to avoid the model guesswork (Be aware of its use of [stored texts for machine learning](https://languagetool.org/legal/privacy/#rephrasing) (2c) in section 2b.)
- ✔️ Reorder the words or sentences of the custom instruction to get different results
- ✔️ More explicit is better than inexplicit on ***lighter model*** (e.g., “6” is better than “6 or fewer.”)
- ✔️ lowercase letter in most case use [10-25 fewer tokens](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) per prompt, allowing slight more words and respond faster
- ✔️ Emoji cost 2-3 (mostly 3) tokens. Remove it if you don't need
- ✔️ Keep ChatGPT 4's replies up to 1000 tokens to save messages (It will avoid more than 1000 tokens.)
- ✔️ Make ChatGPT always disagree with you to be critical
- ✔️ **LLM only improves via its knowledge, not obscure**
- ✔️ Narrow your instructions, create different ones, and use them separately

<details><summary>E.g. EW2</summary>

```
To effectively enhance the readability and comprehensibility of your text, it's quintessentially imperative to adhere to a plethora of meticulously curated strategies, each woven into the fabric of linguistic presentation with the utmost care and attention to detail. Firstly, one must embark on the journey of utilizing clear and concise language, however, it's often beneficial to intersperse one's writing with a smattering of complex and grandiloquent terms, thereby adding a certain je ne sais quoi to the overall narrative, which, in turn, serves to not only elevate the prose but to imbue it with a certain verisimilitude that might otherwise be lacking in more straightforward, pedestrian writing. Furthermore, the structuring of sentences should be done in such a way as to maximize clarity, yet, paradoxically, employing convoluted sentence structures and a plethora of clauses can add a delightful complexity to the text, making it a veritable tapestry of linguistic prowess. Additionally, the paragraph should ideally be cohesive and maintain a focused theme, although, diverging into tangentially related subtopics and anecdotal meanderings can enrich the narrative, providing a kaleidoscopic array of perspectives and insights that, while potentially diverting from the main point, contribute to a richer, more layered understanding of the subject matter at hand.
```
```
**Approx.**: Enhancing text readability involves clear language, interspersed with complex terms for narrative depth. Sentence structure should balance clarity and complexity. Cohesive paragraphs with focused themes are key, yet diversions into related subtopics add richness and depth to the subject matter.

**Accurate**: To improve text readability, use clear language with occasional complex terms. Aim for sentence clarity, but complexity adds depth. Maintain paragraph focus, yet explore related ideas for a richer narrative.

**Loose**: Improve readability with clear language and complex terms. Balance sentence clarity and depth. Keep paragraphs focused, but add related ideas for depth.

**Least**: Clear, complex language; balanced sentences; focused, rich paragraphs.

# Code Stylist
### It is recommended to use ChatGPT 4 or an **equivalent model** for handling complex programming languages.
<details><summary>CS Custom instruction</summary>

> Formats code in three styles: simple, elegant, and clever, providing three code versions with no extra talk.
</details>
<details><summary>E.g. CS1</summary>

**User:**
```py
def calculate_depth(if_positions, b_start, b_end):
	# Calculate depth based on the sizes of if statement blocks
	return sum(1 \
			for a_start, a_end, _ in if_positions \
			if a_start < b_start \
			and a_end > b_end \
			and a_end - a_start > b_end - b_start)
```

**Simple:**
```python
def calculate_depth(if_positions, b_start, b_end):
	depth = 0
	for a_start, a_end, _ in if_positions:
		if a_start < b_start and a_end > b_end and (a_end - a_start) > (b_end - b_start):
			depth += 1
	return depth
```

**Elegant:**
```python
def calculate_depth(if_positions, b_start, b_end):
	return sum(1 for a_start, a_end, _ in if_positions if a_start < b_start < b_end < a_end and (a_end - a_start) > (b_end - b_start))
```

**Clever:**
```python
def calculate_depth(if_positions, b_start, b_end):
	return sum((a_start < b_start < b_end < a_end) and ((a_end - a_start) > (b_end - b_start)) for a_start, a_end, _ in if_positions)

# Ambiguity Detector
### Urged to regenerate 5+ to catch all ambiguities

> List ambiguities—semantic, syntactic, lexical, and narrative—without interpreting. Ask for user explanations with curiosity.
</details>
<details><summary>E.g. AD1</summary>

```
In order to, you know, get to the, like, really important stuff, I, uh, just wanted to, um, basically say that, well, I think, um, we should, like, definitely, you know, try to, uh, avoid using, you know, too many, like, filler words, because, you see, it, like, makes our, um, writing, well, kind of, you know, less clear and, um, more difficult to, you know, understand.
```
```
Your message contains several instances of ambiguity:

1. **Lexical Ambiguity**: The use of "like," "um," "uh," "you know," and "well" as filler words creates uncertainty about their specific meaning in this context.
2. **Syntactic Ambiguity**: The frequent interruptions by filler words create a lack of clarity in sentence structure, making it difficult to parse the intended syntactic relationships between words.
3. **Narrative Ambiguity**: Due to the heavy use of filler words and broken sentence flow, it's challenging to discern the core narrative or main point of your message.

Could you clarify your main message without the filler words for better understanding?

# Guidelines for programming best practices in Python syntax. These guidelines are allowed unless strictly stated.

preferred:
use dictionary mapping or match-case for 4 to 20 conditions to replace if-elif
look-up tables
nesting functions
continue keyword in all loops when needed
comment on illogical code lines
strictly use "tmp" (temp) and "ret" (return_) as abbreviations of variable naming ('tmp' vars declaration disposed within 3 lines)
maximum of 3 indention levels at base level of the source file
type hints naming convention in variable names

avoid:
modifying global variables in any functions
negative wording of variable names, e.g., "not" word in the name
double negation, e.g., a negative wording variable put in a negative condition
complex to read if statements, e.g., more than 2 conditions in a line
strictly no vary approach, e.g., writing the bound check in different ways
chaining methods

suggest:
strictly split high abstraction level functions over 30 lines
all functions do what their names said
strictly avoid more than 2 returns

simplify loops with these functions to improve readability if you can:
sum() # Totals iterable
filter() # Selects items
reduce() # Combines items
product() # Multiplies iterable
map() # Changes items
zip() # Pairs elements
enumerate() # Counts items
transpose() # Flips matrix
"""
```
```
Your text on Python programming best practices contains several ambiguities that need clarification:

1. **Semantic Ambiguity**: 
   - "use dictionary mapping or match-case for 4 to 20 conditions to replace if-elif": It's unclear whether the range "4 to 20" is inclusive or exclusive.
   - "strictly use 'tmp' (temp) and 'ret' (return_) as abbreviations of variable naming": The purpose of the underscore in "return_" is ambiguous.
   - "simplify loops with these functions to improve readability if you can": It's unclear what criteria determine if one "can" simplify loops with these functions.

2. **Syntactic Ambiguity**:
   - "continue keyword in all loops when needed": The phrase "when needed" is vague and could be interpreted in various ways.
   - "strictly avoid more than 2 returns": It's ambiguous whether this refers to more than two 'return' statements per function or more than two return values.

3. **Lexical Ambiguity**: 
   - The word "conditions" in "more than 2 conditions in a line" could refer to conditional statements or to the state of something being conditional.
   - "chaining methods": The term "chaining" can have multiple meanings in different programming contexts.

4. **Narrative Ambiguity**:
   - The overall structure of the guidelines does not clearly differentiate between the categories of "Preferred", "Avoid", and "Suggest". It's not clear if these are progressively less strict categories or if they serve distinct purposes.

Could you please provide more details or examples for these points?

**BBC News: Emerging Tech – AI Revolutionizes Language Learning**

In a groundbreaking advancement, the world of language learning is being revolutionized by the latest artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. This news comes at a time when the demand for multilingual skills is on the rise, driven by an increasingly globalized society.

Developed by a team of linguists and computer scientists, the new AI application, named "LinguaBot," is designed to adapt to the individual learning styles of users. It offers an interactive and engaging approach to mastering a new language, utilizing a mix of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning methods.

The application's AI analyzes the user's progress, focusing on areas that require improvement. Its unique feature is the ability to simulate real-life conversations, providing learners with the invaluable experience of using the language in practical scenarios.

One of the most praised aspects of LinguaBot is its versatility. Whether it’s for a casual learner aiming to learn a few phrases for travel or a professional seeking fluency for business interactions, the application tailors its curriculum accordingly.

Dr. Emily Nguyen, a leading linguist involved in the project, stated, "We are thrilled at the potential of LinguaBot. It’s not just about learning a language; it’s about bridging cultural gaps and connecting people across the globe."

However, this technological leap raises questions about traditional language learning methods. While some educators are excited about integrating AI tools into their curriculum, others express concern about the diminishing role of human interaction in language education.

LinguaBot's developers are addressing these concerns by emphasizing the tool’s role as a supplement rather than a replacement for traditional learning methods. They believe that the application can enhance the learning experience by providing personalized, accessible, and efficient language practice.

As LinguaBot prepares for its global launch next month, the world watches with anticipation. Could this be the key to unlocking a new era of language learning, one where linguistic barriers are a thing of the past? Only time will tell, but the prospects are indeed promising.

**BBC News: Cultural Practices - The Resurgence of Traditional Tea Ceremonies**

In a remarkable blend of tradition and modernity, traditional tea ceremonies are experiencing a resurgence across various cultures, offering a tranquil respite from the hectic pace of contemporary life. This revival highlights the growing interest in cultural practices that emphasize mindfulness, connection, and the appreciation of simple pleasures.

The tea ceremony, an ancient ritual steeped in history and artistry, varies significantly from culture to culture. In Japan, the tea ceremony, known as Chanoyu, involves a precise and meditative preparation of matcha, a powdered green tea. Meanwhile, in China, the Gongfu tea ceremony celebrates the delicate flavors and aromas of oolong tea through a series of skillful infusions.

A key factor driving this renewed interest is the modern quest for relaxation and mindfulness. People are increasingly seeking out practices that provide a sanctuary from the stress of daily life. The tea ceremony, with its slow, deliberate movements and focus on the present moment, offers just that.

Sarah Thompson, a tea ceremony instructor in London, notes, "There's something deeply calming about the tea ceremony. It's not just about drinking tea; it’s a holistic experience that engages all the senses and brings people together."

The ceremony also represents a cultural bridge, offering participants a glimpse into the history and traditions of other countries. This aspect has made tea ceremonies particularly popular among travelers and those interested in cultural exploration.

Despite its traditional roots, the tea ceremony is adapting to contemporary life. In many cities, tea houses now offer modernized versions of the ceremony, sometimes blending elements from different cultures to create a unique experience.

Environmental concerns are also a part of this resurgence, with a growing emphasis on organic and sustainably sourced teas. This shift reflects a broader movement towards environmentally conscious consumption.

As the world becomes increasingly digitized, the simple act of preparing and enjoying a cup of tea in the traditional way offers a much-needed connection to the past and a moment of peace in the present. The tea ceremony's growing popularity is a testament to the timeless human desire for connection, culture, and tranquility in our day-to-day lives.
